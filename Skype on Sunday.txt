Okay guys, this is just so we have an idea of what to expect come Sunday.

Ethan said he is available to do something on Sunday, either in the office or on Skype. Skype might be the easiest thing to do, are there any sort of whiteboard or doodle things we can use on Skype to help our thought processes?

And we are going to need times and Skype accounts as well.
